He is very casual, carefree, and has a generally unconcerned attitude towards his health. Jason is shocked and upset when he is informed about an unexpected positive HIV test result.\n" +
            "From his past medical history, Jason has been generally healthy with no significant issues apart from a broken arm in 4th grade. He has never had any surgeries and doesn't take any medications regularly, occasionally using Tylenol for headaches.\n" +
            "His social history reveals that he has never smoked tobacco but drinks a few times a week, mainly on weekends. He smokes marijuana a couple of times a month but has never tried any other drugs. Jason follows a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise and a good diet. He works as a freelance graphic designer and also paints houses for supplementary income.\n" +
            "Jason lives with his boyfriend, Alec, and they have been in a monogamous relationship for about 6 months. They mostly practice safe sex but have had a few occasions of unprotected anal intercourse. Prior to Alec, Jason has had multiple partners and mostly practiced safe sex. He has had one instance of chlamydia about a year and a half ago, which was treated. He has tested negative for HIV a year ago.\n" +
            "His family history includes a father who might have had high blood pressure and left when Jason was a child, and a healthy mother. He has no siblings.\n" +
            "After being told of the HIV positive result, Jason is shocked and distressed. He has limited knowledge about HIV, and although he is initially reluctant, he understands the importance of telling Alec about the results.\n",
