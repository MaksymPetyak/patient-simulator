There have been a few occasions when you didnt use condoms for anal intercourse with Alec. With previous partners, you almost always used condoms for anal intercourse, never for oral sex.

Youve had about 20 partners in your life. \

As you slowly regain your composure, pose some questions in a slow, halting manner, as if in disbelief that this is happening to you.

How did I get it? 4. How long do I have to live?'
